## Introduction
This presentation is the Course Project of the Developing Data Products course on Coursera.  
It is an R Presentation generated with RStudio.  
The Shiny application is available at [MPG Prediction App](https://riya13.shinyapps.io/mpg_prediction_app/).  
The Shiny app source code is available at [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/sleepycherry13/MPG_Prediction_App).
---

## Overview
The application is written in Shiny, a web application framework for R.  
The source code consists of a single file: `app.R`, which includes both the UI and server logic.  
The application is hosted on RStudioâ€™s shiny server.  
The goal is to provide a user-friendly interface to predict miles per gallon (MPG) based on horsepower and weight.
---

## How the App Works
### Side Panel
- **Horsepower Slider**: Select horsepower (range from 50 to 300).
- **Weight Slider**: Select weight (range from 1 to 6 in thousands of lbs).
### Main Panel
- Displays the predicted MPG based on user input.
---

## Try the App
You can access the Shiny app at [MPG Prediction App](https://riya13.shinyapps.io/mpg_prediction_app/).  
Users can enter different values for horsepower and weight, and observe how the predicted MPG changes in real-time.

### Example Prediction
```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Example code for prediction
hp <- 150
wt <- 3
mpg <- 37 - (0.05 * hp) - (3 * wt)
mpg  # Display calculated MPG
```
## Conclusion
The MPG Prediction App demonstrates the effectiveness of R and Shiny in creating interactive tools for predicting miles per gallon based on horsepower and weight.

Users can easily adjust input values and see real-time predictions, highlighting the app's user-friendly design.
For further exploration, access the app at MPG Prediction App and the source code on GitHub Repository.
